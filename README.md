My Calculator project!!

This is a simple calculator which performs the four most basic operations. It consists of two functions: A main and long function called "calculate" and a short complementary function named "charCount". The first one, makes the operations the user wants to compute, and the second one helps to count the points added to terms involved in the operations.

At the end of this project, the noob will be able to work with the DOM, set proportional spaces in a web page, add events to different elements in the UI and deliver a good-looking product.

This task corresponds to the Javascript Basics module of the Odin Project Web development 101.
